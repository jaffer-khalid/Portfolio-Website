                        I’m a Software Engineering student trying to survive university one deadline at a time.
                        I enjoy learning how things work, breaking them, fixing them, and sometimes questioning
                        why I chose this major in the first place.

                    <p>
                        Outside academics, I’m very serious about the gym. Training isn’t just a hobby for me —
                        it’s discipline, consistency, and a long-term commitment to growth.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’m confident in my ability to help others in the gym perform better. Over the years,
                        I’ve guided friends, gym bros, and beginners, and eventually became a personal trainer.
                        My strength and progress are the result of years of hard work, patience, and learning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I’m also deeply passionate about anime. It inspires me, motivates me, and honestly keeps
                        me sane. My Hero Academia is one of my favorites because it’s all about growth, struggle,
                        and becoming better — something I relate to a lot.

                        On the chill side, I post gym content on TikTok and enjoy connecting with people who share
                        similar interests.

                        I might seem quiet at first, but once you get to know me, you’ll find
                        I’m fun, easy-going, playful, annoying and real.
